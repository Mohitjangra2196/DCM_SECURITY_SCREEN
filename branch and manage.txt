Summary of the Workflow:

----------------------------------------------------Test PC:-------------------------------------------------

git clone (first time)
git checkout -b develop
---------------Make changes------------
git add .
git commit -m "..."
				if need then this 
					git remote add origin https://github.com/Mohitjangra2196/DCM_SECURITY_SCREEN.git
				end if;
git push -u origin develop (repeat these steps for all test changes)


-------Once tested and verified:-----------------
				if need then this 
					git fetch origin
				end if;
										
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge develop
----(Resolve conflicts if any)-------
git push origin main

---------------------------------------------------Main Running Server:-----------------------------------
git clone (first time)
git checkout main
When new stable code is available:
git pull origin main




No, you **do not** always have to use `git checkout -b develop` before starting new work.

Let's clarify the workflow:

  * `git checkout -b develop` is used to **create a new branch** called `develop` and then **switch to it**. You only need to do this **once** for the `develop` branch.

**Here's the correct flow for subsequent work after you've already created the `develop` branch and potentially merged it:**

**Scenario 1: You are starting completely new work after merging `develop` to `main`.**

1.  **Switch back to your `develop` branch (if you're not already there):**

    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    ```

2.  **Pull the latest changes from `main` into `develop` (highly recommended\!):**
    After merging `develop` into `main`, `main` now has your latest code. It's crucial to update your `develop` branch with these changes from `main` so that your `develop` branch is always "up-to-date" with the `main` branch's current state. This avoids re-introducing old code or creating unnecessary merge conflicts later.

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

    This command effectively brings all the changes that went into `main` (which originated from your `develop` branch and any other changes that might have been on `main`) back into your `develop` branch.

3.  **Make your new changes:** Work on your new features or bug fixes.

4.  **Add and Commit:**

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Implement new feature Y"
    ```

5.  **Push to `develop`:**

    ```bash
    git push origin develop
    ```

**Scenario 2: You want to work on a completely new, isolated feature that is distinct from the ongoing `develop` work.**

In this scenario, instead of directly working on `develop`, you might create feature branches *from* `develop`. This is a more advanced but often very clean workflow, especially if you have multiple features in progress or want to isolate specific changes.

1.  **Ensure you are on `develop` and it's up-to-date:**
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin main # Or git pull origin develop if you just want latest develop
    ```
2.  **Create a new feature branch from `develop`:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard
    ```
3.  **Make your changes for this specific feature.**
4.  **Add and Commit:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Implement new dashboard feature"
    ```
5.  **Push your feature branch:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin feature/new-dashboard
    ```
6.  **When this feature is complete, merge it back into `develop`:**
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop # Make sure develop is up-to-date
    git merge feature/new-dashboard
    git push origin develop
    ```
    Then, when `develop` is stable, you'd merge `develop` into `main` as before.

**Key takeaway:**

  * You create a branch (`git checkout -b`) only when you need a **new** branch.
  * Once a branch exists, you simply `git checkout <branch-name>` to switch to it.
  * Always `git pull` from the remote to get the latest changes before starting work or merging, to avoid conflicts and ensure you're working on the most recent codebase.

For your current setup, sticking with one `develop` branch is perfectly fine and simplifies things. So, after a merge to `main`, just `git checkout develop` and `git pull origin main` (to sync `develop` with `main`) before continuing your next set of test changes.
